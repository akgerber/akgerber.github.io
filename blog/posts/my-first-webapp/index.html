A friend in with a background in public health teed up a perfectly-sized intro project, a tool to check extended COVID test expiration dates without trawling through PDFs on the FDA website. I’ve been a software engineer for years and have wanted to learn how to build frontend UIs for a while, after realizing the relative chaos and churn in that field during the early 2010s seems to have been resolved and the toolchain seems pretty mature.\nStarting the project I had heard good things about the next.js framework, and digging a little deeper indicated it supported static websites and server-side rendering, perfect for a tool that provides a UI to filter through into data exported from a spreadsheet.\nI started by working through the tutorial project with the hope that I could adapt it to build a single-page form, but it turned out to be a blog without Typescript support, and thus not easy to adapt to my purposes. I still learned a lot of useful concepts about pre-rendering and static generation that helped me decide where in the framework to do my CSV processing at build-time.\nSince I realized my project would be form-based, I went looking for a useful component library that offered a ‘combobox’ component useful for filtering data. I found Mantine, an open-source project with good Next.js and Typescript support and nice combobox options and datepickers.\nBuilding the project I started a new project from scratch per the Mantine instructions, even though they advised me to use their template. I should have used their template, because it came with a lot of useful features like testing prebuilt for me that I ended up laboriously porting from the template into my project. Whoops. I learned a decent amount about Next.js configuration conventions from that process, however.\nI wrote a function code to process COVID test data from a CSV export from a spreadsheet compiled by my friend, and called it in getStaticProps to populate the index page with the test data.\nThen I browsed Mantine components and found that Select seemed like a good fit to dig into the test data, because it has a searchable mode that allows users to filter a big dropdown by typing in parts of the term they’re looking for.\nI also tried \u0026 abandoned the Datepicker for expiration dates after realizing that Select was a better match for that too, but it’s a very nice component.\nThen I used the onChange prop of Mantine components \u0026 React’s useState hook to implement filtration logic as the form is filled, and to provide an updated expiration dat upon form completion.\nDeployment I decided to use Netlify to deploy at the advice of another friend and because it has a generous free tier. It has an extensive \u0026 simple GitHub integration that provides a ton of useful CI/CD features like automatic preview deployments for PRs. Good job to them, the tool is a pleasure to use.\nChallenges overcome I’d done a bit of frontend at various jobs before to pitch in, so I know a bit about Javascript and Typescript and React. I also spent some time learning Typescript better via Execute Program. So my main challenge was navigating the huge Javascript/Typescript ecosystem, and building something useful, and internalizing React’s programming model well enough to be able to troubleshoot my application effectively.\n","wordCount":"571","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-10-04T23:39:35-04:00","dateModified":"2023-10-04T23:39:35-04:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://alangerber.us/blog/posts/my-first-webapp/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"alangerber.us weblog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://alangerber.us/blog/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://alangerber.us/blog/ accesskey=h title="alangerber.us weblog (Alt + H)">alangerber.us weblog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>My First Webapp</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-10-04 23:39:35 -0400 -0400'>October 4, 2023</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p>I built & deployed <a href=https://covid.alangerber.us/>my first useful webapp</a> over the past week.
