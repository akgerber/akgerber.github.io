    <div class="intro">
        <p>I'm a full-stack engineer&mdash;I've worked on computers at every level from hardware design to JavaScript
            frontends, and have an in-depth understanding of computing that allows me to pick up new technologies at a
            rapid clip. Some of the things I've build live deep within the guts of websites or aren't public, but here
            are a few you can see out in the wild.</p>
        <p>I also have a few small projects available on <a href="https://github.com/akgerber">Github</a>, mostly on
            Android at present.

        <h2>ZocDoc Pediatric Search</h2>
        <div class="entry-content">
            This ZocDoc feature enables users to search ZocDoc by whether patients accept pediatric patients.
            This was built using C# on the backend and jQuery on the frontend.

            What's Etsy's #1 way to make money? The fees it charges sellers for the marketplace.
            A lot of people forget to pay their bill, which isn't so good for revenue. This feature prevents that.

        <h2>Etsy Create Shop Flow</h2>
        <div class="entry-content">
            Etsy's create shop flow, which keeps its marketplace growing, still looked like clunky web form from 1997. I
            rebuilt it to make it interactive with built in help functionality, and up to the aesthetic standard of the
            site.
            <a href="https://www.etsy.com/help/article/246">Here's Etsy's explanation of the flow.</a>

        <h2>8260CSFB SoC Android Power Management </h2>
        <div class="entry-content">
            <p>What's that obscure mass of letters and numbers? 8260CSFB is the part number of a system-on-a-chip (SoC),
                or a whole computer on a single chip. It was the first Qualcomm GSM chipset to use a 4G LTE modem, which
                was a separate chip that talked to the main one and drew more power, so it took a lot of work to get
                power management under Android into a good state. Getting Android working right required making a whole
                ton of builds using Git, repo, and GCC; lots of code review via
                Gerrit, and huge amounts of debugging using tools like a Trace32 JTAG (to debug right on the the chip),
                a Spartan power-testing tool to view the power used by individual power rails on the chip, and writing
                custom Android test apps.</p>
            <p>A big result was the HTC Vivid, the first LTE phone on AT&T, reviewed by Engadget as having <a
                    href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/11/09/htc-vivid-review/">"excellent standby power
                    management"</a>&mdash;precisely the feature I ensured was working at its highest.</p>

        <h2>BodyTrack Android App</h2>
        <div class="entry-content">
            I worked as a student and later a freelancer to start development on an Android app for the <a
                href="http://www.bodytrack.org/">BodyTrack project</a>, a centralized repository to store and upload
            health-related data. My app allowed the user to record and upload GPS locations, pictures of stimuli (like
            food), and meals eaten. Code is available on <a href="https://github.com/akgerber/BodyTrack">GitHub</a>.

        <div class="entry-content">
            I've built a few other random small Android apps, some with code on GitHub:
            <ul>

                    <a href="https://github.com/akgerber/kill-bot">An illustration of a bug I found that caused the

        <h2>Operating System and Thread Library</h2>
        <div class="entry-content">
            As part of Carnegie Mellon's legendary course 15-410 (Operating System Design and Implementation), I worked
            with a partner to build a preemptible multiprocess operating system kernel on x86. The operating system was
            implemented using another project from the course, a threading library of several primitives such as
            mutexes, monitors, and semaphores. Building these gave me a deep respect and understanding about how
            multiprocess computing works at a bare-metal level.
